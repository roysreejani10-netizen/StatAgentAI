# 🤖 StatAgent AI

An **AI-powered data analysis assistant** built with **Streamlit** that automates exploratory data analysis, statistical recommendations, machine learning model selection, and report generation through an **Agentic AI workflow**.

---

## 🚀 Live Demo

**Try the application:**
👉 https://statagentai-x7t7dxij5vfntmicvpt9w2.streamlit.app/

> **Note**
>
> The deployed Streamlit application runs **without the local Ollama backend**. AI-powered dataset interpretation is therefore unavailable in the live demo. To experience all AI features, please run the project locally following the installation guide below.

## 💡 Why StatAgent AI?

Unlike traditional AutoML tools, **StatAgent AI** follows a modular **Agentic AI architecture**, where specialized agents collaborate to automate the complete data science workflow.

### Agents

* 📊 **EDA Agent** – Performs exploratory data analysis and data quality assessment.
* 🧠 **Dataset Understanding Agent** – Interprets uploaded datasets.
* 📈 **Statistical Decision Agent** – Recommends appropriate statistical analyses.
* 🚀 **Planning Agent** – Determines the optimal machine learning workflow.
* 🤖 **Machine Learning Engine** – Trains and evaluates multiple ML models.
* 💡 **Reflection Agent** – Explains why the selected model performed best.

This modular architecture improves transparency, interpretability, and extensibility.
